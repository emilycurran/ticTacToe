**About**

This is an upload of my final project for algorithms and data structures 1. For this project, we were given the task of picking any game we wanted and coding up a version of it in java. For my project, I chose to write a simple console version of tic-tac-toe and an accompanying ai for the user to play against using the minimax algorithm. Using this implementation, the ai is unbeatable and so the user can select a difficulty between 1 and 100 which randomly decides whether the ai will minimax or a random selection to place its next piece. Further explanation of the source code and the minimax algorithm can be found in the report included. 

**To run**

To run the game, simple download the game.java file and compile with "javac game.java" and run with "java game". Further instruction on how to play the game will be printed to the screen.
